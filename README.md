# SmartCompute - The customizable Calculator PWA

## **Goals**

This Project will eventually feature standard Progressive Web App (PWA) features, like installing, caching and offline use.
For now, it will act as a standard website.
The Calculator App itself tries to expand capabilities of modern calculator apps which are either:
 - not customizable, 
 - payed  
 - or full of ads 
 
 ... which is a shame and does not let their users fully utilize the power of their mobile computing devices they have on hand.
